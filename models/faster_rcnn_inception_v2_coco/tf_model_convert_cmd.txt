[ WARNING ] Model Optimizer removes pre-processing block of the model which resizes image keeping aspect ratio. The Inference Engine does not support dynamic image size so the Intermediate Representation file is generated with the input image size of a fixed size.
Specify the "--input_shape" command line parameter to override the default shape which is equal to (600, 600).
The Preprocessor block has been removed. Only nodes performing mean value subtraction and scaling (if applicable) are kept.
The graph output nodes "num_detections", "detection_boxes", "detection_classes", "detection_scores" have been replaced with a single layer of type "Detection Output". Refer to IR catalogue in the documentation for information about this layer.
[ WARNING ]  Network has 2 inputs overall, but only 1 of them are suitable for input channels reversing.
Suitable for input channel reversing inputs are 4-dimensional with 3 channels
All inputs: {'image_tensor': [1, 3, 600, 600], 'image_info': [1, 3]}
Suitable inputs {'image_tensor': [1, 3, 600, 600]}
